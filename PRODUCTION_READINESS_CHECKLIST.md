- [x] **server/index.ts**: Sentry integrated into Express

## 📱 Mobile Fix Summary

### Problem Identified
- iOS Safari and mobile Chrome were blocking third-party cookies
- Cross-origin requests (agricompass.vercel.app → agricompassweb.fly.dev) caused session loss
- Symptoms: Login succeeded (200) but subsequent API calls returned 401

### Solution Implemented
- **Vercel Proxy Configuration**: All API/Socket.IO/Upload requests now go through Vercel
- **Same-Origin Requests**: Browser sees all requests as same-origin (agricompass.vercel.app)
- **Cookie Preservation**: Session cookies now work on all mobile browsers

### Technical Details
```
Before (Cross-Origin):
agricompass.vercel.app → agricompassweb.onrender.com/api/...
❌ Third-party cookie blocked

After (Same-Origin with Proxy):
agricompass.vercel.app/api/... → Vercel → agricompassweb.onrender.com/api/...
✅ First-party cookie preserved
```

## 🔍 Sentry Monitoring (v1.7.0)

### Frontend Features
- **Error Tracking**: Automatic error capture with stack traces
- **Session Replay**: 10% of sessions recorded for debugging
- **Performance Monitoring**: 10% transaction sampling
- **User Context**: Email, role, and user ID tracked
- **Breadcrumbs**: User actions logged for context

### Backend Features
- **HTTP Tracing**: All Express requests monitored
- **Performance Profiling**: CPU and memory profiling enabled
- **Error Handler**: Automatic exception capture
- **Sample Rate**: 10% for cost efficiency

### Sentry Projects
- **Frontend**: React (DSN: ...177149520)
- **Backend**: Node.js (DSN: ...201791056)
- **Environment**: production
- **Dashboard**: https://sentry.io/organizations/agricompass/projects/

## 🚀 Deployment Process

### 1. Push to GitHub
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "fix: Mobile cookie blocking - proxy API through Vercel + Sentry v1.7.0"
git push origin main
```

### 2. Automatic Deployments
- **Vercel**: Deploys frontend automatically on push
- **Render**: Deploys backend automatically on push

### 3. Post-Deployment Testing

#### Desktop Browser (Chrome/Firefox/Edge)
- [ ] Login as farmer → Dashboard loads
- [ ] Login as buyer → Marketplace loads
- [ ] Check Sentry dashboard for events
- [ ] Verify no console errors

#### iOS Safari (iPhone)
- [ ] Login as farmer → Dashboard stats load ✅
- [ ] Check notifications work ✅
- [ ] Verify no 401 errors ✅
- [ ] Test real-time updates ✅

#### Android Chrome
- [ ] Login as buyer → Products load ✅
- [ ] Add to cart works ✅
- [ ] Checkout process completes ✅
- [ ] Session persists after app switch ✅

## 📊 Expected Results

### Desktop Behavior (Unchanged)
- Direct API calls to backend in dev mode
- Proxied through Vercel in production
- All features work as before

### Mobile Behavior (Fixed)
- **Before**: Login succeeded, then immediate 401 errors
- **After**: Login succeeds, all subsequent requests work
- Session cookies preserved across page refreshes
- Real-time notifications work via Socket.IO proxy

### Performance Impact
- **Latency**: +10-30ms (Vercel proxy overhead)
- **Reliability**: Improved (no cookie blocking issues)
- **Security**: Enhanced (same-origin policy benefits)

## 🔐 Security Considerations

### Cookie Settings (No Changes Needed)
- `httpOnly: true` prevents XSS attacks
- `secure: true` in production (HTTPS only)
- `sameSite: 'lax'` allows cross-site navigation
- Domain not set (defaults to current origin)

### Proxy Security
- Vercel rewrites are server-side (no exposed URLs)
- Render backend still validates all requests
- CORS configuration unchanged (backward compatible)
- Session validation remains server-side

## 📝 Documentation

- **MOBILE_FIX_DOCUMENTATION.md**: Comprehensive technical explanation
- **CHANGELOG.md**: Updated with v1.7.0 changes
- **This file**: Production readiness checklist

## ⚠️ Known Issues

### Large Bundle Size
- Client bundle: 1,521 KB (415 KB gzipped)
- **Cause**: Sentry SDK, React Query, UI libraries
- **Impact**: Minimal (modern CDNs handle well)
- **Future**: Consider code splitting in v1.8.0

### PostCSS Warning
- Non-critical warning during build
- **Impact**: None (assets transform correctly)
- **Action**: Can be ignored for now

## 🎯 Success Criteria

### Critical (Must Pass)
- [x] TypeScript compilation: 0 errors
- [x] Production build: Successful
- [ ] Desktop login: Works
- [ ] Mobile (iOS) login: Works + data loads
- [ ] Mobile (Android) login: Works + data loads

### Important (Should Pass)
- [ ] Sentry captures errors on frontend
- [ ] Sentry captures errors on backend
- [ ] Real-time notifications work on mobile
- [ ] File uploads work through proxy

### Nice to Have
- [ ] Session replay visible in Sentry
- [ ] Performance metrics showing in Sentry
- [ ] No mobile console errors

## 📞 Troubleshooting

### If Mobile Still Shows 401
1. Clear browser cache/cookies
2. Check Vercel deployment logs
3. Verify vercel.json deployed correctly
4. Test with incognito/private mode

### If Sentry Not Working
1. Check DSNs in environment variables
2. Verify Sentry dashboard shows projects
3. Test error capture manually
4. Check browser console for Sentry errors

### If Proxy Not Working
1. Verify Vercel rewrites in deployment
2. Check Render backend is responding
3. Test direct backend URL works
4. Check CORS headers in response

## 🔄 Rollback Plan

If issues occur:
1. Revert vercel.json to previous version
2. Revert API URL changes in client code
3. Deploy previous commit
4. Mobile issue will return but desktop remains functional
