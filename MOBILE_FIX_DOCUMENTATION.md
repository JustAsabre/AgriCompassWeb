# Mobile Cookie Issue Fix - Complete Documentation

## 🔍 Problem Identified

### Issue
**On mobile devices (especially iPhone/iOS Safari):**
- Site loads correctly ✅
- User can login successfully ✅
- Immediately after login, all API requests return 401 Unauthorized ❌
- No data loads (products, dashboard stats, etc.) ❌
- Real-time features (Socket.IO) don't work ❌

**On desktop/laptop:**
- Everything works perfectly ✅

### Root Cause
**Third-Party Cookie Blocking**

Your application has a **split architecture**:
- **Frontend:** `agricompass.vercel.app` (Vercel)
- **Backend:** `agricompassweb.fly.dev` (Fly.io)

When the frontend makes API requests to the backend, the browser sees them as **cross-origin requests**. The backend sets a session cookie, but:

1. **Desktop browsers:** Generally accept cross-origin cookies
2. **Mobile browsers (especially iOS Safari):** Block third-party cookies by default for privacy

**What happens:**
1. User logs in → Backend sends session cookie ✅
2. Browser blocks/doesn't save the cookie (mobile only) ❌
3. Next API request → No session cookie sent ❌
4. Backend: "No session cookie = not authenticated" → 401 Unauthorized ❌

---

## ✅ Solution Implemented

### Strategy: API Proxying through Vercel

Instead of making cross-origin requests from `agricompass.vercel.app` to `agricompassweb.fly.dev`, we configured Vercel to **proxy** all API requests. This makes them **same-origin** from the browser's perspective.

**How it works:**
1. Browser makes request to `agricompass.vercel.app/api/...` (same origin!) ✅
2. Vercel internally forwards to `agricompassweb.fly.dev/api/...` ✅
3. Backend responds with session cookie ✅
4. Cookie is now **first-party** (same domain) → Mobile browser accepts it ✅
5. Future requests include the cookie → Authentication works ✅

## 📝 Files Modified

### 1. `vercel.json` - Proxy Configuration

**Changes:**
- Added API proxy rewrite rule
- Added Socket.IO proxy rewrite rule
- Added uploads proxy rewrite rule

**Code:**
```json
{
  "rewrites": [
    {
      "source": "/api/:path*",
      "destination": "https://agricompassweb.fly.dev/api/:path*"
    },
    {
      "source": "/socket.io/:path*",
      "destination": "https://agricompassweb.fly.dev/socket.io/:path*"
    },
    {
      "source": "/uploads/:path*",
      "destination": "https://agricompassweb.fly.dev/uploads/:path*"
    },
    {
      "source": "/(.*)",
      "destination": "/index.html"
    }
  ]
}
```

**What it does:**
- Any request to `/api/*` → Vercel forwards to `https://agricompassweb.fly.dev/api/*`
- Any request to `/socket.io/*` → Vercel forwards to `https://agricompassweb.fly.dev/socket.io/*`
- Any request to `/uploads/*` → Vercel forwards to `https://agricompassweb.fly.dev/uploads/*`
- All other requests → Serve `index.html` (SPA routing)

**Impact:**
✅ API requests are now same-origin (mobile browsers accept cookies)
✅ Socket.IO connections work through proxy
✅ File uploads work through proxy
✅ No breaking changes for desktop users

---

### 2. `client/src/lib/queryClient.ts` - API Base URL

**Changes:**
- Modified `API_BASE_URL` to use relative URLs in production
- Kept direct backend URL for local development

**Before:**
```typescript
const API_BASE_URL = import.meta.env.VITE_API_URL || 'https://agricompassweb.fly.dev';
```

**After:**
```typescript
// In production (Vercel), use relative URLs to go through Vercel's proxy
// In development, use VITE_API_URL to talk directly to backend
const API_BASE_URL = import.meta.env.DEV 
  ? (import.meta.env.VITE_API_URL || 'http://localhost:5000')
  : ''; // Empty string for relative URLs in production
```

**What it does:**
- **Development mode** (`npm run dev`): Uses `VITE_API_URL` (direct backend connection)
- **Production mode** (Vercel): Uses empty string → relative URLs like `/api/...`

**Impact:**
✅ Production requests go through Vercel proxy (same-origin)
✅ Development still talks directly to backend (no proxy needed locally)
✅ All API calls automatically use correct base URL

---

### 3. `client/src/lib/auth.tsx` - Authentication API Base URL

**Changes:**
- Updated `API_BASE_URL` to match queryClient pattern
- Auth requests now use relative URLs in production

**Before:**
```typescript
const API_BASE_URL = import.meta.env.VITE_API_URL || 'https://agricompassweb.fly.dev';
```

**After:**
```typescript
// In production (Vercel), use relative URLs to go through Vercel's proxy
// In development, use VITE_API_URL to talk directly to backend
const API_BASE_URL = import.meta.env.DEV 
  ? (import.meta.env.VITE_API_URL || 'http://localhost:5000')
  : ''; // Empty string for relative URLs in production
```

**What it does:**
- Login, logout, session checks use relative URLs in production
- Session cookies are now first-party cookies

**Impact:**
✅ Login works on mobile devices
✅ Session persistence works on mobile
✅ Authentication state maintained across pages

---

### 4. `client/src/lib/notifications.tsx` - Socket.IO Connection

**Changes:**
- Updated Socket.IO connection URL to use proxy in production
- Socket.IO now connects through Vercel proxy

**Before:**
```typescript
const API_BASE_URL = import.meta.env.VITE_API_URL || 'https://agricompassweb.fly.dev';
const socketUrl = API_BASE_URL || undefined;
```

**After:**
```typescript
// In production (Vercel), use current origin (empty string = relative)
// In development, use VITE_API_URL to talk directly to backend
const socketUrl = import.meta.env.DEV 
  ? (import.meta.env.VITE_API_URL || 'http://localhost:5000')
  : undefined; // undefined = current origin in production
```

**What it does:**
- **Development**: Connects directly to backend Socket.IO server
- **Production**: Connects to current origin (Vercel), which proxies to backend

**Impact:**
✅ Real-time notifications work on mobile
✅ Socket.IO authentication works (cookies sent)
✅ WebSocket connections work through proxy

---

- Check deployment logs
- Verify vercel.json was applied

**Check 2: Clear Mobile Browser Cache**
- Safari: Settings → Safari → Clear History and Website Data
- Chrome: Settings → Privacy → Clear Browsing Data

**Check 3: Check Browser Console**
- Use Safari Web Inspector (iPhone)
- Use Chrome DevTools (Android)
- Look for 401 errors or CORS errors

**Check 4: Verify Proxy Working**
- Open browser DevTools → Network tab
- Filter by "api"
- Check Request URL (should be relative: `/api/...`)
- Check Response headers
